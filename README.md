# üå´Ô∏è Air Quality & Health Impact Analysis

This project focuses on understanding air pollution and its potential impact on public health through detailed data analysis. It examines historical air quality records, identifies patterns and trends over time, and explores how changes in pollution levels may relate to different health conditions.
